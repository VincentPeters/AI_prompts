# AI-Powered Project Development Framework

A structured framework for AI-assisted software project planning and development using Claude.

## Overview

This framework provides a comprehensive approach to developing software projects from scratch using Claude. It creates detailed documentation through a structured, tiered process.

## Workflow

1. **Generate MVP** - Create initial project roadmap with minimal viable features
2. **Generate Features** - Expand detailed feature specifications
3. **Refiner** - Enhance and optimize implementation details

## Usage

1. Use Claude Desktop with MCP server
2. Upload the framework markdown files as tools
3. Follow the tiered documentation process:
   - Development roadmap (project overview)
   - Feature documents (detailed specifications)
   - Task documents (implementation guidance)

## Documentation Structure

- `development_roadmap.md` - Overall project plan with feature tracking
- `/docs/features/[Feature]/feature.md` - Detailed feature specifications
- `/docs/features/[Feature]/feature_task_[n].md` - Individual implementation tasks

## Benefits

- Clear separation between WHAT needs to be built and HOW to implement it
- Structured approach to planning complex projects
- Enables AI to make informed implementation decisions
- Provides comprehensive tracking of project progress
