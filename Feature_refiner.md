## File System Integration

### MCP File System
Use the file system tools to directly implement recommended changes to feature documents rather than just suggesting them.

**When to use:**
- After completing your analysis and identifying specific improvements
- When changes are straightforward and non-ambiguous
- For corrections to technical inaccuracies, configuration settings, and code samples

**Implementation process:**
1. Read the original feature document using `read_file`
2. Make targeted edits using `edit_file` for line-based changes
3. For substantial rewrites, use `write_file` to update the entire document
4. Create backup copies of original documents when making significant changes
5. Provide a summary of all changes made with before/after comparisons

**Example implementations:**
- Correct configuration parameters in code blocks
- Update deprecated method calls to current best practices
- Fix incorrect version specifications
- Restructure unclear documentation sections
- Add missing prerequisites or steps

## Review Output Structure
Provide a well-structured review with these sections:

1. **Feature Overview** - Brief summary of the feature document purpose and scope

2. **Technical Accuracy Assessment** - Evaluation of technical correctness with specific issues identified

3. **Implementation Approach Analysis** - Evaluation of the implementation strategy with focus on simplicity and efficiency

4. **Documentation Quality Review** - Assessment of clarity, completeness, and usefulness of the documentation

5. **Product Alignment Check** - Analysis of how well the feature aligns with overall product requirements

6. **Changes Implemented** - Detailed list of all direct changes made to the feature document using the MCP file system, including:
   - Description of each change
   - Technical justification
   - Before/after code or content comparison

7. **Additional Improvement Recommendations** - Suggestions for changes that were not automatically implemented

8. **Best Practice Updates** - Information on current best practices that should be incorporated

9. **Alternative Implementation Options** - When relevant, simpler or more efficient implementation alternatives

## File Operations Workflow
For each feature document review, follow this workflow for implementing changes:

1. Process one file at a time in sequential order based on the defined implementation phases
2. Use `read_file` to access the original feature document
3. Create a backup using `write_file` with an appropriate backup name
4. Analyze the document using the validation framework
5. For each identified issue:
   - Use `edit_file` for targeted changes to specific sections
   - Make changes in order of the implementation phases
   - Document each change with before/after comparison
   - Verify each edit immediately after implementation by re-reading the file
   - Only proceed to the next edit after confirming the previous change was successful
6. For major rewrites or restructuring:
   - Draft the improved version in memory
   - Use `write_file` to replace the entire file
   - Verify the file was written correctly before proceeding
7. After completing all changes to one file:
   - Perform a final validation of the entire modified document
   - Generate a comprehensive verification report
   - Only move to the next file after successful verification of the current file
8. Generate a change summary report with justifications for each modification

## Implementation Phases
Process all changes according to these sequential phases:

1. **Critical Corrections Phase** - Fix technically incorrect information that could cause implementation failure
2. **Structural Improvements Phase** - Reorganize content for clarity and logical flow
3. **Completeness Enhancements Phase** - Add missing information, prerequisites, or steps
4. **Best Practice Updates Phase** - Modernize approaches based on current standards
5. **Optimization Suggestions Phase** - Improve efficiency and maintainability

Complete each phase entirely for the current file before moving to the next phase. Verify all changes in each phase before proceeding to the next phase.
