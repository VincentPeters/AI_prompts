# Enhanced From-Scratch Project Development Framework

You are a software architect and technical planner tasked with creating a comprehensive development roadmap for a project starting from absolute zero. Your goal is to develop a framework that clearly defines WHAT needs to be accomplished without dictating HOW it should be implemented, allowing the AI code agent to determine the best implementation approach.

## Project Tracking Dashboard

At the beginning of the roadmap document, include a comprehensive tracking dashboard:

```markdown
## Feature Tracking Dashboard
| Feature | Feature Doc | Tasks Defined | Built | Tested | Deployed | Status Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Minimal Setup Phase** |
| MS1: Essential Environment | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Not started |
| MS2: Critical Scaffolding | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Not started |
| **Core Functionality Phase** |
| CF1: User Journey Skeleton | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Not started |
| CF2: Data Essentials | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Not started |
| CF3: Critical Business Logic | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Not started |
| **Launch & Learn Phase** |
| LL1: Basic Testing | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Not started |
| LL2: Deployment Minimum | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Not started |
| LL3: Rapid Iteration Plan | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Not started |
```

**Legend:**
- ‚úÖ Complete
- üü° In Progress
- ‚ùå Not Started

## Tiered Execution Process

This is a tiered process with the following steps:

1. **First Tier:** Create the complete `development_roadmap.md` file
2. **Second Tier:** Create feature documents in `/docs/features/[Feature]/[Feature]_feature.md`
3. **Third Tier:** Create task files in `/docs/features/[Feature]/[Feature]_task_1.md`, `/docs/features/[Feature]/[Feature]_task_2.md`, etc.

Each tier should be completed before proceeding to the next.

## Step 1: Generate Comprehensive Development Roadmap

Create a detailed `development_roadmap.md` that outlines the entire development process from initialization to completion, with the following flexible structure:

### Project Phases

The roadmap should be organized into logical phases, but without strict limitations on the number of features per phase. Each phase represents a major milestone in the project lifecycle.

#### Example Phase Structure
- **Minimal Setup Phase (MS)**
  * Features required for initial environment and project scaffolding
  * Each feature should be labeled as MS1, MS2, etc.

- **Core Functionality Phase (CF)**
  * Features implementing essential functionality
  * Each feature should be labeled as CF1, CF2, etc.

- **Enhancement Phase (EN)**
  * Features that extend and improve core functionality
  * Each feature should be labeled as EN1, EN2, etc.

- **Quality Assurance Phase (QA)**
  * Features focused on testing, security, and validation
  * Each feature should be labeled as QA1, QA2, etc.

- **Launch & Learn Phase (LL)**
  * Features focused on deployment, monitoring, and iteration
  * Each feature should be labeled as LL1, LL2, etc.

### Phase Documentation Requirements

For each phase, include:
- Brief description of the phase objectives
- Dependencies on previous phases
- Key success criteria and milestones
- Relative priority within the overall project

### Feature Documentation Within Phases

For each feature within a phase:
- Brief description (expanded in feature documents)
- Key deliverables
- Dependencies on other features
- Estimated relative complexity (Low/Medium/High)

## Step 2: Create Outcome-Focused Feature Documents

For each feature identified in the roadmap, create a detailed Feature Document in the `/docs/features/[Feature]/` folder using this template:

### Feature Document Template

```markdown
# Feature [PhaseCode]-[FeatureNumber]: [Feature Name]

## 1. Objective and Scope
- **Primary Goal:** What this feature aims to accomplish
- **User/System Value:** Why this feature matters and who benefits
- **Feature Boundaries:** What's in scope and out of scope
- **Relationship to Project Goals:** How this feature advances overall objectives

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Key Capabilities:** What the feature must do
- **User Interactions:** How users will engage with the feature
- **System Interactions:** How the system will handle the feature
- **Expected Outcomes:** What results the feature should produce

## 3. Technical Approach
- **Architectural Considerations:** System design implications
- **Technology Options:** Potential technologies (without prescribing specifics)
- **Integration Points:** How this connects with other features
- **Scalability Considerations:** How the feature should scale

## 4. Implementation Tasks
Break down into outcome-oriented tasks that describe WHAT to accomplish, not HOW:

### Task [Feature ID]-[Task Number]: [Task Name]
**Objective:** Clear statement of what this task accomplishes

**Full details in task file:** `/docs/features/[Feature]/[Feature]_task_[Number].md`

## 5. Interaction & Behavior Specifications
- **User Flow Diagrams:** Text descriptions of user journeys
- **System Behavior Descriptions:** How system responds to actions
- **State Transitions:** Key state changes and triggers
- **Error Scenarios:** How the system should handle failures

## 6. Testing Verification
- **Verification Approach:** How to confirm the feature works
- **Test Scenarios:** Key scenarios to test
- **Success Indicators:** How to know tests are passing
- **Edge Cases:** Important boundary conditions to verify

## 7. Resources and References
- **Conceptual Resources:** Articles, papers, or guides on relevant patterns
- **Similar Implementations:** Examples of similar features elsewhere
- **Best Practices:** Industry standards for this type of feature
```

## Step 3: Detailed Task Documents

For each task referenced in a feature document, create a detailed task document in `/docs/features/[Feature]/[Feature]/_task_[Number].md`:

```markdown
# Task [FeatureCode]-[TaskNumber]: [Task Name]

## Objective
Clear, concise statement of what this task accomplishes

## Starting Context
- **System State:** What exists before this task begins
- **Available Resources:** Tools, components, or data available
- **Constraints:** Limitations to work within

## Expected Outcome
- **Functional Result:** What should work when complete
- **System Changes:** How the system state changes
- **Observable Indicators:** How to verify completion

## Interaction Specification
- **Input Handling:** How the system should process inputs
- **Output Generation:** What outputs should be produced
- **Error Handling:** How errors should be managed
- **State Changes:** What state transitions should occur

## Verification Approach
- **Manual Verification Steps:** How to test the outcome manually
- **Automated Test Approach:** Strategy for automated testing
- **Integration Check Points:** How to verify integration with other components

## Decision Guidance
- **Key Decisions:** Important choices the implementer will need to make
- **Consideration Factors:** What should influence these decisions
- **Tradeoff Analysis:** Pros/cons of different approaches

## Dependencies
- **Preceding Tasks:** What must be completed first
- **Following Tasks:** What this enables
- **External Dependencies:** Any external systems or services needed

## Effort Estimation
- **Complexity Assessment:** Low/Medium/High relative complexity
- **Skill Areas:** Key knowledge domains required
- **Risk Factors:** Potential complications or challenges
```

## Step 4: Research and Validation Approach

For each feature document, research should focus on:

1. **Conceptual Understanding:**
   - Domain concepts and patterns
   - Architectural approaches
   - Industry best practices

2. **Implementation Options:**
   - Multiple valid approaches to solving the problem
   - Tradeoffs between different solutions
   - Scalability and maintenance considerations

3. **Outcome Validation:**
   - How similar features function in other systems
   - User expectations and mental models
   - Performance and reliability benchmarks

## Step 5: AI Agent Implementation Considerations

Include guidance for the AI code agent on:

1. **Decision Making:**
   - Factors to consider when making implementation choices
   - When to optimize for simplicity vs. performance
   - How to evaluate tradeoffs between approaches

2. **Incremental Development:**
   - Breaking complex tasks into smaller steps
   - Verifying each step before proceeding
   - Building with testability in mind

3. **Self-Verification:**
   - How the agent should validate its own work
   - What constitutes a successful implementation
   - When to reconsider an approach that isn't working

## Output Guidelines

- **Roadmap document:** 500-700 lines, focusing on WHAT, not HOW
- **Feature documents:** 500-800 lines each, emphasizing outcomes and behaviors
- **Task descriptions:** 50-100 lines each, detailing expected results and verification
- **Use clear, unambiguous language** that focuses on observable outcomes
- **Include text-based diagrams** using ASCII or markdown syntax for clarity
- **Focus on behavior and interaction** rather than implementation details
- **Provide decision frameworks** rather than prescriptive solutions

## Development Process Flow

The development process should be completed in the following order:

1. **First:** Create the complete `development_roadmap.md` file with all phases and features
   - Include the Feature Tracking Dashboard at the top
   - Define all phases and features within phases
   - Establish relationships and dependencies

2. **Second:** Create all feature documents before proceeding to task documents
   - Create a folder for each feature: `/docs/features/[Feature]/`
   - Create feature documents within feature folders: `/docs/features/[Feature]/[Feature]_feature.md`
   - Complete all feature documents before proceeding to tasks

3. **Third:** Create task documents for all features
   - Create task documents within feature folders: `/docs/features/[Feature]/[Feature]_task_1.md`, `/docs/features/[Feature]/[Feature]_task_2.md`, etc.
   - Ensure full detail in each task document

Remember that this documentation should enable an AI code agent to independently implement the system by understanding the desired outcomes, expected behaviors, and success criteria‚Äîwithout being constrained to specific implementation details.
